## U.S. State Government Tax Collections

I created a choropleth map which plots the total taxes collected by U.S. states. When a state on the map is clicked, a bar chart will display showing the top five taxes collected in that state.

## Data
The data used was a modified version of the U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Survey of State Government Tax Collections for 2015. For the purpose of my analysis, some elements of the data were removed (e.g. Geographic ID, Tax Type Code, and Year) and others were added (e.g. State Abbreviations).  All other aspects of the data were left intact.

The original data was released on 09/23/2016 and can be found here: https://www.census.gov/govs/statetax/. For information about the data, survey methodology, etc., refer to the following: https://www.census.gov/govs/classification/
